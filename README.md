# FileUpload_PHP
Dynamic php file upload using Iframes(HTML)

This repository contains code for dynamic php file upload. The technique of this file upload is to use two iframes in html web page.
One iframe will have file upload form to take file input and the response of the file upload form of this iframe will be shown in second iframe which is actually hidden in the web page. On the basis of response we will get in second iframe we can display the result in first iframe whether the file upload is successful or not.<br>JavaScript and JQuery is combinedly used to get the response from second iframe and display the result in first iframe.<br>
eg. If we get 200 as response in second iframe(This response will be generated by php script) then file upload successful will be shown in the first iframe
